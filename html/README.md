# HTML

## Getting Ready

Beyond introducing you to web programming, the overarching goal of this problem is to empower you to teach yourself new languages so that you can stand on your own at the end of the year. We’ll guide you through each, but if you nonetheless find yourself Googling and asking lots of questions of classmates and staff, rest assured you’re doing it right!

First consider joining Daven for a tour of `HTML`. Focus for now on the `HTML`. We'll add in `CSS` in the next lab.

# What do I do now?

Note there is already an `HTML` file, `mypage.html` set up for you in the sandbox on the right. Your job is to add several `HTML` tags with a title, some text, a picture and a link.

Because this assignment will result in something different for each person, there’s no check50 for this one. Make sure that you’ve included everything listed above and you have no broken links or permission issues and you should be good to go.

## How to View Your Web Page

Type http-server in the terminal and click on the link. You will open a new browser window with your web page!
